A few things to note:
- This is v1, so changes/feedback are welcome

- When you have time, please take a moment to read through the documentation to ensure correctness.

- I have added comments in areas that I am definitely unclear about, though there may be significantly more. To find these, search for `<!` which indicates that start of a comment in .md files.

- I tried to be comprehensive, creating a section for instructors, and a second section for students, as well as keywords. I anticipate the document to continue to grow, as well as the keywords.

- Certain functionality, I did not have access to (such as grading assignments, since my test class/course doesn't have students), etc. I believe to have added comments where this is the case. 

- This document is in markdown form. In practice, this would look a lot more visually appealing (text size, sections, open/close tabs, etc). Most importantly, would likely contain a navbar that also contains the table of contents for ease of access.

- Once a landing page is present, will consider adding a section about 'getting started'.

- There are a few areas yet to fill out (not a priority): 
  - The top of the file could benefit from a little introduction about the application, etc.
  - `1.1. Courses` - a small blurb would be useful.
  - `1.2. Classes` - a small blurb would be useful.
  
  
 Once this is in a working state, will likely remove this repo and move it into a centralized repository where I will begin work on the landing page.
